# SortManager Project
## Introduction
This project uses 3 different algorithms to sort a randomly produced array.
The user is prompted for their preferred sorting algorithm and to indicate the
length of the randomly produced array. The sorted array is then returned. 

##Motivation
This project is the culmination of things I have learnt during the first 2 weeks 
training as a Java developer at Sparta Global. Knowledge gained during this time has allowed me 
to create a project that includes a logger, Exceptions, test cases and interfaces. 
This project also aims to adhere to SOLID principles.

##Technologies
This Project was written in Java (JDK 11) and built using IntelliJ and Maven dependencies 

##Launch
To launch this project you require IntelliJ (community or ultimate) and 
then need to clone this github repo and open this project from IntelliJ.
