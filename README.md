# SortManager Project

## Requirements
- To implement 3 different sorting algorithms 
- To give the user a choice of sorting alogirthms
- To give the user a reasonable way of creating the array that will need to be sorted
- To have a reasonable way of dealing with the object creation
- To carry out performance testing for the sorting algorithms

## What I've accomplished 
- A Bubble, Merge and Binary Tree sort were implemented for sorting the array
- User is prompted for their choice of sorting algorithm
- Random array is created by prompting user for the length of the array
- Sorted array is returned and printed out
- Performance testing was carried out to observe which sorting algorithm is the fastest 
- Factory pattern was used to deal with object creation

## Motivation
This project is the culmination of things I have learnt during the first 2 weeks 
training as a Java developer at Sparta Global. Knowledge gained during this time has allowed me 
to create a project that includes a logger, Exceptions, test cases and interfaces. 
This project also aims to adhere to SOLID principles and uses the factory design pattern to deal with object creation.
